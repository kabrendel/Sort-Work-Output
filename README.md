# Sort-Work-Output
Our work ERP system supports Excel exporting for all data.
That system does not sort the information for workload prioritization.
To make that easier for my team I wrote some VBA functions and set up a macro that lets everyone create a prioritized list
of the work that needs done, so everyone works from the same understanding.
